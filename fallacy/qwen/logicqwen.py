You're an expert in logic. 
Here's a categorisation of the 15 logic errors:
False dilemma: The presentation of an issue as having only two possible outcomes, either right or wrong, without recognising that additional alternatives may exist.
Equivocation: The misleading use of a word or phrase that has multiple meanings, creating ambiguity and leading to confusion in interpretation or reasoning.
False Premise: The establishment of an argument based on an unfounded, non-existent, or unreasonable assumption, leading to flawed reasoning or invalid conclusions.
False Analogy: The assumption that if A and B share certain characteristics, then B must also possess other attributes of A, despite lacking a valid basis for this inference.
Wrong Direction: The incorrect attribution of causality by reversing the cause-and-effect relationship, assuming the effect is the cause and the cause is the effect.
Fallacy of composition: The mistaken assumption that what is true for a part of something must also be true for the whole, disregarding the possible differences between individual components and the entire entity.
Begging the question: The use of a statement as both the premise and the conclusion, assuming the truth of what is to be proven instead of providing independent support.
False Cause: The incorrect assumption that a causal relationship exists between two events solely because one follows the other, failing to account for coincidence or other influencing factors.
Inverse Error: The mistaken reasoning that if A implies B, then not A must imply not B, overlooking the possibility that B may still occur due to other factors.
Improper transposition: The incorrect inference that if A implies B, then B must also imply A, failing to recognise that implication is not necessarily reversible.
Improper Distribution or Addition: The erroneous reasoning that individual effects can be directly summed or distributed across a group without considering their actual impact or interaction.
Contextomy: The act of selectively quoting or altering a statement, advertisement, or published material in a way that distorts its original meaning, often misrepresenting the intent of the original source.
Nominal Fallacy: The mistaken interpretation of a metaphorical or figurative expression as a literal statement, leading to a misunderstanding of its intended meaning.
Accident fallacy: The misapplication of a general rule to a specific case where exceptions should be considered, treating the rule as absolute without regard for context or relevant circumstances.
Self-Contradiction: The statement that directly negates its own truth rather than circularly assuming its conclusion as a premise.
