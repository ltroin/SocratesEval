    "baseline explanation": "The sentence misinterprets the phrase 'the pen is mightier than the sword' by taking it out of context. This phrase metaphorically suggests that writing and ideas can have more influence than violence or force. Meanwhile, 'actions speak louder than words' is a different concept, emphasizing that what people do is more important than what they say. The sentence incorrectly assumes these two expressions are directly contradictory, which is a false premise, as they address different aspects of influence and communication.",
    "candidate explanation": "This compares two metaphors that measure different things. The 'pen vs. sword' proverb refers to ideas outlasting violence over time (e.g., laws shaping societies more than battles), while 'actions vs. words' compares literal deeds to empty talk. The flaw is equating 'sword' (action) with 'words' (speech), when the pen represents organized ideas, not just spoken words. A written constitution (pen) can indeed outlast wars (sword), even if actions generally matter more than casual chatter.",

The premise that sound could choose a different, more efficient way to travel is unfounded.",
    "candidate explanation": "Sound waves aren't physically 'traveling a wavy path' — the sinusoidal shape represents how air particles vibrate back-and-forth as energy passes through them. The wave itself moves forward in a straight line at a fixed speed.

    "sentence": "I can clearly see how the Titanic took on water and eventually sank. How is it possible the designers missed this fatal flaw?",
    "label": "False premise",
    "baseline explanation": "The sentence assumes that the designers of the Titanic should have been able to foresee the exact circumstances of its sinking, which is unreasonable. The designers couldn't predict the future events that led to the disaster, such as the collision with an iceberg, which was not a 'flaw' in the design but an unforeseen accident.",
    "candidate explanation": "This reasoning assumes the flaw was obvious at the time of design, but hindsight bias ignores historical context. The designers lacked the real-world data from the disaster — they couldn’t foresee every scenario, and safety standards/understanding of risks in 1912 were vastly different. What seems 'clear' now wasn’t necessarily evident before the tragedy occurred.",
    "rationale": "Score: 2. Both explanations identify the same core logical flaw: that the argument anachronistically assumes the Titanic's designers should have foreseen events or known things that were not foreseeable or knowable at the time of design. Both focus on the designers' knowledge and the predictability of the disaster.",

    "label": "Equivocation",
    "baseline explanation": "The sentence plays on the double meaning of 'dead language'—one being a language no longer used in everyday life, and the other regarding as a language spoken by the dead. It humorously confuses the figurative and literal senses, leading to flawed logic.",
    "candidate explanation": "The joke confuses 'dead language' (no native speakers) with literal death. Speaking Latin doesn't connect you to deceased people, just as speaking any unused language wouldn't let you communicate with ghosts.",
    "rationale": "Score: 2. Both explanations identify the same logical flaw: the equivocation on the term 'dead language,' confusing its meaning as a language no longer spoken in everyday life (or with no native speakers) with the idea of it being a language spoken by literally dead people.",

    "label": "False Premise",
    "baseline explanation": "The sentence assumes that by changing the size of an Olympic pool, the amount of gold mined will somehow increase, which is not true. The amount of gold mined is a fixed quantity and is not dependent on the size of a pool. Reducing the size of a pool doesn't change the actual amount of gold available. Additionally, having more golds would solve global poverty is a naive wish.",
    "candidate explanation": "Changing the size of an olympic pool is just redefining a measurement — it doesn’t create more actual gold. The total amount of gold mined remains the same, so pretending there’s 'twice as much' by shrinking the pool size is like renaming 'miles' to 'half-miles' and claiming you’ve doubled distances. Global poverty also isn’t caused by a lack of gold, but by complex issues like wealth distribution, access to resources, and systemic inequality.",
    "rationale": "Score: 2. Both explanations identify the same two core logical flaws: 1) the erroneous belief that changing the size of a measurement unit (Olympic pool) changes the actual quantity of gold, and 2) the naive assumption that more gold would solve global poverty. The Candidate elaborates but diagnoses the same flaws in the same aspects of the argument.",

    "label": "False Premise",
    "baseline explanation": "The sentence assumes power plants can simply run on electricity, ignoring the fact that power plants are what generate electricity in the first place. It creates a circular idea by skipping over the need for a primary energy source like nuclear, gas, or coal.",
    "candidate explanation": "This logic is circular. Power plants *generate* electricity—they don’t run on it. A plant that 'runs off electricity' would need another source of electricity to operate, which just pushes the problem back to: where does *that* electricity come from? The question confuses the output (electricity) with the input (fuel or energy source).",
    "rationale": "Score: 2. Both explanations identify the same core logical flaw: the argument presents a circular idea by assuming power plants run on electricity (their output) rather than a primary energy source (their input).

    "label": "Nominal Fallacy",
    "baseline explanation": "The sentence misunderstands the term 'shelf life' as if it literally means food must be placed on a shelf. 'Shelf life' actually refers to the duration food remains safe and suitable for consumption, regardless of where it is stored. Placing food on the floor doesn't affect its shelf life in the way the sentence implies.",
    "candidate explanation": "This reasoning confuses physical placement with preservation. Shelf life depends on factors like temperature, moisture, and contamination, not literal placement on a shelf. Putting food on the floor might actually expose it to dirt, pests, or bacteria, shortening its freshness—the opposite of extending shelf life.",
    "rationale": "Score: 1. Both explanations identify the core logical flaw as misunderstanding 'shelf life' to mean literal placement on a shelf, rather than the duration food remains suitable for consumption. However, the Candidate explanation adds a distinct point about how placing food on the floor could introduce contaminants (dirt, pests, bacteria) that shorten its actual freshness, an aspect of practical consequence not detailed in the Baseline, which focuses more strictly on the terminological misunderstanding.",

    "baseline explanation": "The question pretends to seek a statistical probability, but the real answer is built into the action itself: if you're flipping a coin a million times, you've already wasted your time. The humor comes from posing a mathematical question while ironically proving the point through the act itself—a perfect example of begging the question fallacy.",
    "candidate explanation": "The logic here confuses objective probability with subjective value. Coin flips have calculable odds, but whether flipping a coin is a \"waste of time\" depends on personal goals or context (e.g., practicing patience vs. needing quick results). The question mistakenly treats a value judgment as a mathematical probability.",
    "rationale": "Score: 1. The Candidate captures the Baseline's point that the argument inappropriately attempts to apply statistical probability to a concept (\"waste of time\") that is actually a value judgment or whose answer is inherent in the action.

    "candidate explanation": "The logic confuses different people with the same phrase. The first statement refers to *a different person* being shot every 15 seconds, not the *same* person repeatedly. The follow-up question mistakenly assumes it’s the same individual surviving multiple shootings, which misinterprets the original statistic.",
