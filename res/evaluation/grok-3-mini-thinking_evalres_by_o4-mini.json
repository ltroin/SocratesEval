But the comparison fails logically because flies are drawn to specific chemical cues, not to the quality of cooking. So while it’s a funny insult, it’s based on a misleading link—the joke pretends the food and waste are equivalent just because flies react differently, ignoring that they share no relevant properties.",

    "sentence": "If I flip a coin 1,000,000 times, what are the odds of me wasting my time?",
    "label": "Begging the question",
    "baseline explanation": "The question pretends to seek a statistical probability, but the real answer is built into the action itself: if you're flipping a coin a million times, you've already wasted your time. The humor comes from posing a mathematical question while ironically proving the point through the act itself—a perfect example of begging the question fallacy.",
    "candidate explanation": "The issue here is that it's mixing up probability with personal judgment. Coin flips are random events, but whether flipping it a million times is a waste of time depends on your goals or reasons for doing it, not on any odds from the flips themselves—it's more about if the activity is meaningful to you.",
    "rationale": "Score 0: The candidate discusses mixing probability with personal judgment, whereas the baseline identifies a begging-the-question fallacy about the question’s built-in answer—completely different flaws.",

    "sentence": "In America, someone is shot every 15 seconds. How is that person still alive?",
    "label": "Equivocation",
    "baseline explanation": "The sentence plays on the ambiguity of 'someone', making it sound like the same person is shot every 15 seconds, which creates a humorous misunderstanding.",
    "candidate explanation": "The sentence mixes up the statistic by implying it's the same person getting shot repeatedly every 15 seconds, but it actually means different people are involved in shootings at that average rate, so the question doesn't logically follow.",
    "rationale": "Score: 2. Both explanations identify the exact same flaw: the ambiguity of “someone,” which falsely suggests the same person is shot every 15 seconds rather than different people.",
    "score": "2"
