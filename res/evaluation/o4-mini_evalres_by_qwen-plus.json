So when someone says, “If you put root beer in a square cup, do you get beer?” they’re jokingly asking if root (beer) × root (cup) equals “beer,” since squaring a square root cancels it out in math. It’s a clever play on mathematical terminology, not a logical statement about beverages.",
    "candidate explanation": "This joke mixes up 'root beer' with the math idea of a 'square root.' Putting a drink in a square cup doesn’t perform any calculation, so root beer stays root beer—it won’t magically turn into normal beer.",

The sentence misinterprets this metaphor as a literal statement about gaining muscle, which is a contextomy. Additionally, the reasoning that not gaining muscle from watching TV implies that the TV might kill you is an inverse error, as it incorrectly assumes that if not gaining strength means something will kill you, then not being killed must mean gaining strength.

The word 'conditioner' is being used in two different contexts, leading to a misunderstanding. Washing a dog with conditioner is about grooming, while conditioning in the context of Pavlov's experiment is about training a response. These are not related, so the expectation that washing a dog with conditioner would lead to a conditioned response is illogical.",
