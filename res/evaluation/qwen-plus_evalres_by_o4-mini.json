    "baseline explanation": "The sentence makes a flawed comparison between the design of Switzerland's flag, which features a cross, and the concept of electrical charge. The flag's design has no relation to the country's political stance of neutrality. The analogy is false because the characteristics of a flag's design do not determine or reflect a country's political policies.",

    "baseline explanation": "The sentence misuses the concept of \"chance\" by implying that a dime, being worth more than a penny, gives you a higher probability of landing on heads. But coin value has nothing to do with probability—a dime doesn’t make heads 10 times more likely than a penny. Both have a 50/50 chance if the flip is fair. The joke stems from confusing monetary value with mathematical likelihood.",
    "candidate explanation": "This doesn't make sense because the probability of a coin landing on heads is independent of its size or value. A dime, like any other two-sided coin, still only has a 50% chance of landing on heads, not 500%. Percentages over 100% in this context don't apply to probabilities, as they can't exceed 100%.",

It humorously treats a common marketing line as if it implies the existence of a rogue alternative worth seeking out.

    "baseline explanation": "The sentence plays on the double meaning of 'dead language'—one being a language no longer used in everyday life, and the other regarding as a language spoken by the dead. It humorously confuses the figurative and literal senses, leading to flawed logic.",
    "candidate explanation": "The logic doesn't make sense because speaking a dead language like Latin doesn't actually connect you to dead people. A 'dead' language simply means it's no longer spoken by communities as a living language, but it has nothing to do with communicating with the deceased.",
    "rationale": "Score 2: The Candidate identifies the same double-meaning confusion of “dead language” (literal versus figurative) and the flawed inference that speaking Latin connects one to the dead, matching the Baseline’s logical flaw exactly.",

    "sentence": "Mankind has only mined 3.42 olympic pools of gold in history. Why don't we make olympic pools half as big so we have twice the gold? Have I solved global poverty?",
    "label": "False Premise",
    "baseline explanation": "The sentence assumes that by changing the size of an Olympic pool, the amount of gold mined will somehow increase, which is not true. The amount of gold mined is a fixed quantity and is not dependent on the size of a pool. Reducing the size of a pool doesn't change the actual amount of gold available. Additionally, having more golds would solve global poverty is a naive wish.",
    "candidate explanation": "The logic here doesn't work because changing the size of Olympic pools doesn't actually create more gold. The amount of gold mined is a fixed quantity, and altering the dimensions of a pool only changes its volume, not the total amount of gold in existence. Global poverty isn't solved by redefining measurements; it requires addressing economic, social, and resource distribution issues.",
    "rationale": "The candidate pinpoints the identical causal fallacy—changing pool size won’t increase gold mined—and the same naive oversimplification that more gold alone would solve global poverty.",

    "sentence": "Why the big fuss over nuclear, gas, or coal energy? Can't we just have power plants that run off of electricity?",
    "label": "False Premise",
    "baseline explanation": "The sentence assumes power plants can simply run on electricity, ignoring the fact that power plants are what generate electricity in the first place. It creates a circular idea by skipping over the need for a primary energy source like nuclear, gas, or coal.",
    "candidate explanation": "This logic doesn't make sense because electricity is what these power plants produce, not what they run on. Nuclear, gas, and coal plants generate electricity by using those fuels as energy sources. Saying a power plant runs on electricity is like saying a bakery makes bread using bread—it misunderstands how the process works.",
    "rationale": "The Candidate Explanation pinpoints the same circular reasoning flaw—that power plants generate rather than run on electricity and require primary fuels like nuclear, gas, or coal—matching the Baseline’s critique exactly.",

    "sentence": "If food only has a certain shelf life, why don't we just set it all on the floor?",
    "label": "Nominal Fallacy",
    "baseline explanation": "The sentence misunderstands the term 'shelf life' as if it literally means food must be placed on a shelf. 'Shelf life' actually refers to the duration food remains safe and suitable for consumption, regardless of where it is stored. Placing food on the floor doesn't affect its shelf life in the way the sentence implies.",
    "candidate explanation": "The logic here doesn't make sense because setting food on the floor wouldn't extend its shelf life or solve any related problems. In fact, placing food on the floor would likely expose it to more dirt, germs, and contamination, making it less safe to eat and potentially reducing its usable life even further.",
    "rationale": "Score: 1. The candidate agrees that placing food on the floor doesn’t extend or affect its shelf life, but it adds a new contamination argument and fails to mention the baseline’s key point about misunderstanding the term “shelf life” as literal placement on a shelf.",

    "label": "Begging the question",
    "baseline explanation": "The question pretends to seek a statistical probability, but the real answer is built into the action itself: if you're flipping a coin a million times, you've already wasted your time. The humor comes from posing a mathematical question while ironically proving the point through the act itself—a perfect example of begging the question fallacy.",
    "candidate explanation": "The sentence mixes up two unrelated ideas. Flipping a coin 1,000,000 times is a statistical experiment with clear odds for outcomes like heads or tails. Whether it's a waste of time depends on personal goals or context, not probability. It’s like asking if eating pizza makes you good at math—it just doesn’t connect logically.",
    "rationale": "Score 0: The candidate cites a mismatch of ideas/non sequitur and context dependency, whereas the baseline pinpoints a circular reasoning (begging the question) built into the coin-flipping action. There is no overlap in identified fallacies.",

    "label": "Equivocation",
    "baseline explanation": "The sentence plays on the ambiguity of 'someone', making it sound like the same person is shot every 15 seconds, which creates a humorous misunderstanding.",
    "candidate explanation": "The sentence misunderstands the statistic. When it says 'someone is shot every 15 seconds,' it means this happens repeatedly across different people and situations, not that the same person is being shot over and over again. The question 'How is that person still alive?' assumes incorrectly that it's always the same individual, which doesn't make sense in context.",
    "rationale": "Score 2: The candidate explanation identifies the same ambiguity of ‘someone’ and the mistaken assumption that it refers to one person being shot repeatedly, matching the baseline’s logical flaw and aspect exactly.",
