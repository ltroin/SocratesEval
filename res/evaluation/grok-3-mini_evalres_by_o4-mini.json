Since “trilobyte” isn’t a real unit of digital storage, the joke creates a humorous blend of tech jargon and paleontology, making it sound like your computer is storing prehistoric creatures instead of files. It’s a classic example of pun-based wordplay through sound-alike confusion.",

    "baseline explanation": "The sentence plays on the ambiguity of 'someone', making it sound like the same person is shot every 15 seconds, which creates a humorous misunderstanding.",
    "candidate explanation": "The sentence mixes up the idea by making it sound like the same person is getting shot over and over and somehow surviving, but it actually means different people are being shot at that rate, so there's no mystery about one person staying alive.",
    "rationale": "Score 2: Both explanations identify the same ambiguity in the referent ‘someone,’ causing it to sound like the same person is shot repeatedly rather than different people. The candidate’s mention of ‘surviving’ is just elaboration on that misunderstanding, not a new flaw.",
    "score": "2"
