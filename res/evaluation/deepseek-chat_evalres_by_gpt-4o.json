    "baseline explanation": "The sentence makes a flawed comparison between the design of Switzerland's flag, which features a cross, and the concept of electrical charge. The flag's design has no relation to the country's political stance of neutrality. The analogy is false because the characteristics of a flag's design do not determine or reflect a country's political policies.",

The designers couldn't predict the future events that led to the disaster, such as the collision with an iceberg, which was not a 'flaw' in the design but an unforeseen accident.",
    "candidate explanation": "This reasoning is flawed because hindsight bias makes the cause of the Titanic's sinking seem obvious now, but the designers couldn't have foreseen every possible scenario at the time. What's clear after an event isn't always predictable before it happens.",

    "label": "Equivocation",
    "baseline explanation": "The sentence plays on the double meaning of 'dead language'—one being a language no longer used in everyday life, and the other regarding as a language spoken by the dead. It humorously confuses the figurative and literal senses, leading to flawed logic.",
    "candidate explanation": "The logic is flawed because a 'dead language' just means it's no longer spoken as a native language, not that it has any connection to deceased people. Speaking Latin doesn't imply communication with the dead—it's a misunderstanding of the term 'dead language.'",

    "label": "False Premise",
    "baseline explanation": "The sentence assumes that by changing the size of an Olympic pool, the amount of gold mined will somehow increase, which is not true. The amount of gold mined is a fixed quantity and is not dependent on the size of a pool. Reducing the size of a pool doesn't change the actual amount of gold available. Additionally, having more golds would solve global poverty is a naive wish.",
    "candidate explanation": "The logic here is flawed because changing the size of an Olympic pool doesn't actually increase the amount of gold that exists or has been mined. The measurement (Olympic pools) is just a unit of comparison—it doesn't affect the real quantity of gold. Solving global poverty requires addressing systemic issues like wealth distribution, not arbitrary changes to measurement units.",
    "rationale": "Score: 2. The Candidate Explanation identifies the same logical flaw as the Baseline: changing the size of an Olympic pool does not affect the actual amount of gold mined. Both explanations also address the naive assumption that more gold would solve global poverty, emphasizing systemic issues instead.",

    "baseline explanation": "The sentence assumes power plants can simply run on electricity, ignoring the fact that power plants are what generate electricity in the first place. It creates a circular idea by skipping over the need for a primary energy source like nuclear, gas, or coal.",
    "candidate explanation": "This reasoning is flawed because power plants don't 'run off' electricity—they generate it. Electricity is the output, not the input. The question is like asking, 'Why bake bread? Can't we just have ovens that run off of bread?' It misunderstands the basic function of power plants.",

    "baseline explanation": "The sentence misunderstands the term 'shelf life' as if it literally means food must be placed on a shelf. 'Shelf life' actually refers to the duration food remains safe and suitable for consumption, regardless of where it is stored. Placing food on the floor doesn't affect its shelf life in the way the sentence implies.",
    "candidate explanation": "The logic here is flawed because the shelf life of food is determined by factors like exposure to air, moisture, and bacteria—not its physical location. Putting food on the floor doesn't extend its shelf life; it actually increases contamination risks and spoilage. The suggestion misunderstands what 'shelf life' means.",
    "rationale": "Score: 1. The Candidate correctly identifies that 'shelf life' is misunderstood in terms of its determinants, matching the Baseline's point about the term's meaning.

The humor comes from posing a mathematical question while ironically proving the point through the act itself—a perfect example of begging the question fallacy.",
    "candidate explanation": "The sentence mixes a mathematical probability question (coin flips) with a subjective judgment (wasting time). The odds of flipping a coin are calculable, but whether it's a 'waste of time' depends on personal perspective, goals, or context—not probability. The logic fails by treating an opinion as if it were a measurable outcome.",
    "rationale": "Score: 0.
