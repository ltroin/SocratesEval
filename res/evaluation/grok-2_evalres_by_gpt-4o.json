The flag's design has no relation to the country's political stance of neutrality. The analogy is false because the characteristics of a flag's design do not determine or reflect a country's political policies.",

The sentence misinterprets this metaphor as a literal statement about gaining muscle, which is a contextomy. Additionally, the reasoning that not gaining muscle from watching TV implies that the TV might kill you is an inverse error, as it incorrectly assumes that if not gaining strength means something will kill you, then not being killed must mean gaining strength. But ironically, you're right: watching TV nonstop for a week can pose serious health risks",
    "candidate explanation": "The saying 'whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger' is meant more as a metaphor for resilience and overcoming challenges, not a literal promise of physical strength.

The word 'conditioner' is being used in two different contexts, leading to a misunderstanding.
