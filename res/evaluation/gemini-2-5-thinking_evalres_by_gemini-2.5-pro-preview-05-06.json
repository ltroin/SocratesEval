This is an inverse error because it overlooks the fact that pedaling backward doesn't necessarily have the opposite effect; it might still provide exercise and not lead to weight gain.",
    "candidate explanation": "It's an interesting thought, but whether you pedal forwards or backwards, you're still doing exercise and burning calories. Gaining weight really comes down to taking in more calories than you burn, not so much the direction you're pedaling on the bike.
