When you eat a watermelon, its water content doesn't simply add to your existing percentage. The fallacy lies in directly adding percentages (75% + 92%) without considering that percentages represent proportions of different wholes. After eating a watermelon, your total water content would increase, but it would remain below 100% as a proportion of your new total mass. A percentage can never exceed 100% when describing a portion of a whole. This demonstrates improper addition by treating percentages as absolute values rather than proportions, and also shows a fallacy of composition by assuming properties of parts combine in a simplistic way.",

        "details": "This statement contains a significant logic error known as hindsight bias. The speaker claims to \"clearly see\" how the Titanic sank, but this understanding comes after knowing the outcome. This creates a False Premise - the assumption that what is obvious in retrospect should have been obvious to the designers beforehand. The statement assumes that there was a single, obvious \"fatal flaw\" that the designers negligently missed, when in reality the disaster involved complex factors including unexpected circumstances, design tradeoffs, and operational decisions that weren't predictable in advance. There's also an element of Wrong Direction in attributing causality - suggesting the designers should have anticipated specific circumstances that led to the sinking.",

        "logic fallacies": "equivocation, nominal fallacy, false analogy",
        "details": "This statement contains an equivocation fallacy by using 'dead' in two different contexts - 'dead language' (a language no longer spoken as a native language) and 'dead people' (deceased individuals). The statement exploits the ambiguity in the word 'dead' to suggest a connection between speaking Latin and communicating with deceased individuals. It's also a nominal fallacy because it interprets the metaphorical expression 'dead language' in a literal sense. Additionally, it makes a false analogy by assuming that properties of one thing (a language being 'dead') would transfer to enable communication with entities sharing a similar descriptor ('dead' people).",

        "details": "This statement contains multiple logical errors. First and most obviously, it commits the Improper Distribution or Addition fallacy by suggesting that changing the unit of measurement (making Olympic pools half as big) would somehow double the actual quantity of gold. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of how measurement works - changing the measuring unit doesn't change the physical amount of something. There's also a False Premise in assuming that redefining measurement units affects physical quantities. Additionally, it commits a False Cause fallacy by implying that having 'twice the gold' (through measurement manipulation) would solve global poverty, with no valid causal connection established. Finally, there's a Nominal Fallacy aspect where the person confuses changing a name or measurement standard with changing the reality of what exists.",

        "details": "This statement contains a fundamental logical error by misunderstanding what electricity is and how energy systems work. Electricity is not a primary energy source but rather a form of energy that must be generated from primary sources like nuclear, gas, coal, solar, etc. The statement makes the false premise that electricity exists as an independent power source that could run power plants. This also represents a nominal fallacy by misinterpreting what 'electricity' actually is - treating the term as representing a fuel source rather than understanding it's an energy carrier. Additionally, it begs the question by suggesting electricity could generate electricity without explaining where the initial electricity would come from, creating a circular reasoning problem.",

        "details": "This statement contains a Nominal Fallacy as the primary error because it mistakenly interprets the metaphorical expression 'shelf life' as a literal statement about food needing to be on a shelf. The person is playing with the literal meaning of 'shelf' in 'shelf life' when the term actually refers to how long food remains edible before spoiling, regardless of where it's stored. There's also Equivocation in how the word 'shelf' is being deliberately misused by treating the metaphorical term literally. Additionally, the statement contains a False Premise in assuming that food having a 'shelf life' means it specifically needs to be on a shelf, which is unfounded.",

The primary fallacy is a False Premise, as it assumes that 'wasting time' is a quantifiable outcome of coin flipping with calculable odds. There's also Equivocation in how it uses the statistical term 'odds' but applies it to a subjective concept rather than an objective outcome like heads or tails. Finally, it exhibits a Nominal Fallacy by treating the figurative concept of 'wasting time' as if it were a literal, measurable statistical outcome that could be calculated from coin tosses.",

This misinterpretation treats a statistical expression as if it were a literal statement about a single individual. This is primarily an equivocation fallacy (misusing the ambiguous term 'someone') and secondarily a nominal fallacy (taking a figurative statistical expression literally).",
