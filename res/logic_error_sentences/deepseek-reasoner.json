        "details": "The argument commits a false analogy by treating the size of an olympic pool (a unit of measurement) as causally linked to the actual quantity of gold mined, implying that redefining the unit magically doubles the physical gold. It also assumes a false cause: altering measurement standards cannot retroactively increase real-world resource quantities. The fallacy of composition arises by conflating abstract numerical changes (e.g., halving the pool's volume definition) with tangible effects on wealth distribution, ignoring that gold's scarcity and value are independent of arbitrary unit definitions.",

This ignores the fundamental role of power plants (to produce electricity). Additionally, the **accident fallacy** applies if the question assumes a general rule ('use electricity') can be applied to the specific case of power plants without addressing their unique purpose (generating electricity).",

This is an equivocation fallacy, as the term 'shelf life' is ambiguously interpreted. It also commits a nominal fallacy by treating the metaphorical term 'shelf life' as a literal statement about physical shelves. The false premise lies in assuming that removing food from shelves (placing it on the floor) would affect its actual shelf life, which is unrelated to physical storage location but determined by factors like decay and preservation.",

The false analogy arises from conflating distinct instances of shootings with a single person's survival.",
