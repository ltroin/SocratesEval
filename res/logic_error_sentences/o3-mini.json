        "details": "The statement is based on an erroneous numerical claim. Claiming that 4/3 (which is greater than one) of any population have a particular trait implies more than 100 percent, which is impossible.

It also draws an invalid comparison by treating a change in measurement as if it would increase physical output (false analogy). Additionally, the term \"olympic pool\" is used ambiguously: defined as a volumetric measure in one part of the argument and then manipulated in another, which qualifies as equivocation.

This is a false premise because it ignores that storage conditions (like cleanliness, temperature control, etc.) can influence food quality and safety. Moreover, it commits a false analogy by equating the inevitable decay of food with the irrelevance of proper placement; just because food spoils eventually doesn\u2019t logically mean that placing it on the floor (or neglecting its proper storage) is acceptable.",

        "details": "The sentence implicitly assumes that flipping a coin 1,000,000 times is inherently a waste of time, which is an unwarranted presumption (false premise). It further frames the situation in a binary way (either wasting time or not), ignoring the possibility that the action might hold value beyond a simple 'waste or not' dichotomy (false dilemma). Additionally, using the word 'odds' to gauge the subjective quality of 'wasting time' conflates a strictly mathematical concept with a value judgment, which creates ambiguity (equivocation).",

It leads one to assume that being shot by a gun always causes death, when in reality many victims survive gunshot wounds.
