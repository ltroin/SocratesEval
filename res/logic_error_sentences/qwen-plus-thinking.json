The phrase 'someone is shot every 15 seconds' refers to the frequency of shootings in general, not the same individual being shot repeatedly. This creates an equivocation fallacy by confusing the collective statistic with an individual's experience. Additionally, the question 'How is that person still alive?' introduces a false dilemma by implying that anyone who is shot must die, which is not necessarily true. There\u2019s also an element of contextomy, as the original meaning of the statistic (a broad observation) is distorted into a misleading narrative about a single person.",

Additionally, there is a false dilemma implied by questioning how many countries have their 'own moons,' suggesting that moons could be divided among countries rather than recognizing that all countries share the same moon.

This creates an equivocation fallacy because 'not applicable' can mean different things depending on context. Additionally, there is a hint of false dilemma if the speaker implies that either sodium must have no symbol or its symbol must align with some unstated expectation (e.g., being related to its English name).

This constitutes a false analogy because it assumes that these two systems, designed for entirely different purposes and contexts, can be directly compared in terms of 'superiority.' Additionally, there's an equivocation on the term 'superior,' as superiority depends heavily on context (e.g., effectiveness in warfare vs. functional purpose).

Additionally, there's an element of 'false dilemma' since it implies that either the whole burger must be made of cow parts or the claim is false, ignoring the possibility that only specific parts (e.g., the patty) are meant.

Additionally, there's an element of 'equivocation', as the word 'hot' is used metaphorically in one context (scientific temperatures) and literally in another (a TV overheating).
