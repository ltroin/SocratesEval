    "details": "The statement contains a logical error by describing digital x-rays as 'healthy' simply because they use less radiation than traditional x-rays. This is a False Premise because it assumes that reducing radiation exposure makes the procedure inherently 'healthy,' when all radiation exposure carries some health risk. It's also an Equivocation fallacy in the use of the term 'healthy,' which misleadingly suggests the procedure actively promotes health rather than merely reducing harm. Additionally, there's a False Analogy in implicitly comparing 'less harmful' to 'healthy' - they are not equivalent concepts. While the comparative claim about 75% less radiation may be factually accurate, framing radiation exposure as 'healthy' is logically unsound.",
