The false analogy is present in the assumption that the ability to interbreed is the sole criterion for determining species membership. Additionally, the argument may be seen as an instance of improper distribution or addition, as it attempts to extrapolate a general conclusion about all coyotes based on a specific characteristic (interbreeding) without considering other relevant factors.",
